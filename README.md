## Code Fellows 201 Projects

## Group Members: Zachary Flowers Kevin LaMarca, Joshua McCluskey

### Project Prep# 1

#### Group Project: Team Agreement

##### Cooperation Plan

* **Kevin LaMarca's Strengths:** Javascript, debugging and problem solving.
* **Areas of growth:** CSS and design abilities/knowledge. Commenting on my code to improve readability

* **Zachary Flowers' Strengths:** I feel my strengths reside in seeing problems through regardless of the situation. I am willing to try creative solutions to issues or take backseat if necessary to see things work. Regarding code, I feel I am most comfortable with design elements and structural planning.  
* **Areas of growth:** I feel I have much room for growth in CSS but it is rather enjoyable to spend time in this area. Implementation of JavaScript is most like my biggest area of growth although I do enjoy spending time working through and solving problems though this will more than likely require assistance.
  
* **Joshua McCluskey's Strengths:** Git, GitHub, Systematic thinking, problem solving and finding solutions.
* **Areas of growth:** CSS design layouts and effectively communicating.

* We'll use Trello and use dates, deadlines, and individual assignments for cards to know what we are doing on day to day basis.

##### Conflict Plan

* When you see something, say something. Dealing with an issue right away, and not letting things fester. Be frank. Don't take it personally, it is a critique of the project and not to you as a person
* If one person takes too much on, address and distribute tasks evenly and have that person be the mentor or Breakout into pair programming.
* If there is a disagreement or conflict, we all come together and talk it out and bring in the third person or someone outside the group to mediate disagreement. Vote on what works and what doesn't work.
* Safe Word: Chinchilla. (Use this word when there is too much conflict or you feel unsafe).
* Pair programming and MOB programming will be called when someone is struggling with a concept or problem.
* Not Adequately Contributing
  * Checking in with someone who is not adequately contributing and see how they are
  * If they're not contributing adequately and not responding bring it up with instructor team

##### Communication Plan

* Use UTC timezones to help with timezones
* Use Slack to contact each other
* Meetings in Remo or Zoom
* Break as you need them.
* Communicate on Trello first and then escalate it talk about it.
* Open communication is completely open.
* Open up the room to discuss during each merge party.
* Every couple hours check in with everyone to see how they are feeling as a person and not how its going with work. Focusing on you as a human.

##### Work Plan

* We'll use Trello and use dates, deadlines, and individual assignments for cards to know what we are doing on a day to day basis.

* We'll assess everyone's abilities and comfort levels for each task and see who wants to take on which tasks. Ask for assistance, if you need help with anything.

##### Git Process

* GitHub will have all files
* Shared Repository with contributors
* Merge parties where we are all present to review code to merge to the development branch. As the project progresses we will merge to the main branch with 100% concensus.
